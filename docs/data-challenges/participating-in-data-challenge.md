# Participating in a NDP Data Challenge

Participating in Data Challenges is an excellent opportunity to collaborate on the development of scientific workflows and explore innovative solutions to complex problems.

## Joining a Data Challenge

1. **Log in to Wildfire Commons**
    - Ensure you have an active account and credentials to access the platform.

2. **Explore Challenges**
    - Navigate to the *Education Hub* and select *Explore*. Challenges are listed according to their publication dates.
3. **Select a Challenge**
    - Once you find a challenge that interests you, click *Open* to view its details.

4. **Review Information**
    - Carefully read all the details and instructions before joining a challenge. Joining a challenge involves the allocation of resources, so ensure it aligns with your availability and goals.

5. **Join the Challenge**
    - Click *Join Data Challenge* to initiate team creation.
    - By default, you will be added to your team as the first member.
    - If the challenge permits individual participation, you can name your team and proceed.

6. **Add Team Members**
    - Enter the emails of your team members, preferably academic accounts.
    - Ensure that none of the emails are associated with another active team in the same challenge, as this will prevent team creation.
