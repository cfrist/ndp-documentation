# Components of a Module

The main components of an NDP module are the following: 
 
## Module Card

The module card is meant to provide all general information and metadata asssociated with the module. The module card is a key component of the module creation, as this information will be displayed in the modules catalog, giving learners an overview of the content you're sharing.

The components of the module card include the following:

**Module Name** 

The name of the shared module. The name shall atract learners attention by encompassing clearly the content of the module. 

**Description** 

The description should consist of 2-3 paragraphs and provide an overview of the module's topic, including the data, model(s), and the context in which they are applied. This section is crucial for capturing the learner's interest and should offer a clear understanding of the module's domain.

**Objectives**

The objectives should clearly outline the skills, knowledge, and tasks that learners will acquire or accomplish upon completing the module. These objectives should be presented as bullet points, offering a concise and clear guide to what learners can expect to achieve by engaging with the module.

**Tags** 

Each module must have at least 3 tags associated to them for their use in the modules catalog. These tags are intended to facilitate the search and discovery of modules by domain, topic, and the specific skills learners are expected to acquire through the module.

**Instructions**

The instructions should provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how to interact with the module. If the module includes multiple notebooks or attached resources, the instructions must clearly outline the order in which these notebooks should be completed and how to manage any complementary resources. Additionally, where applicable, the instructions should inform the learner about the expected outputs at each stage of the module, helping them understand the progression and anticipated results as they work through the content.

## Data

The module creation process is designed to integrate data sources from the NDP catalog. Before incorporating data into their module, SMEs are encouraged to explore the data catalog to identify and select the most relevant datasets.

For SMEs who wish to incorporate their own data into the module, there are two available options:

1. They can register their data in the NDP catalog, provided that the data meets the established registration standards.
2. They can attach the data directly to the module, subject to a storage limit of #GB.

## GitHub link

The module creation process requires the provision of a **public** GitHub repository link. This repository should include all essential files needed for the successful completion of the module, such as requirements files-i.e. `requirements.text`-, code, and any complementary resources like additional data or documentation.  

SMEs are strongly encouraged to use Jupyter Notebooks as the primary form of interaction within their module, due to their highly interactive nature.

A good GitHub repository must contain:
