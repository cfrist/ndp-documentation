# Module Creation Process

The following page guides you through the process of creating an module. Take into consideration that the creation of publication of modules is reserved for contributors with Subject Matter Expert (SME) credentials. 

### Setup

Before creating a module, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Register your dataset:** Identify or [register](../catalog/register-data.md) the dataset for your module in the [Catalog](https://nationaldataplatform.org/ckandata).  
2. **Prepare your code repository**: Set up a GitHub repository containing all the necessary notebooks, helper scripts, and `requirements.txt` files for the correct execution of your module in JupyterLab. The following [repository]() provides an example. 
3. **Prepare your model repository**: If your module uses a model available through HuggingFace or GitHub, prepare the `.git` link for its inclusion into your module.
