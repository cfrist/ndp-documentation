# Understanding NDP Modules - Use Cases

This page offers an overview of three distinct use cases for NDP modules, designed to give module developers a clearer understanding of the capabilities and applications of these modules.

## Formal Education 

The primary purpose of NDP modules is to support formal education, with two key scenarios for their use: integration into traditional classroom settings and availability as open-learning resources.

#### Classroom setting

Within a classroom environment, NDP Modules serve as core curriculum units that are integrated into the [NDP Classroom](). The modules are designed to align with course objectives and provide students with interactive hands-on activities and assessments. In addition, NDP modules can be used to facilitate the completion of assignments, particularly those that require the use of specialized datasets or access to high-performance computing resources.

    The use of NDP classroom and private modules is limited to users with the *educator* role. Such role must be requested at `ndp@sdsc.edu`


#### Open-Learning Resource
When used as open-learning resources, NDP modules offer flexible, self-paced educational opportunities that can be accessed by learners outside the traditional classroom. These modules are often designed to be concise units of knowledge, focusing on specific topics or skills. However, they can also be part of a broader educational sequence. For example, an open module might be one element of a comprehensive series on streaming data, with a specific focus on visualization techniques for handling and interpreting such data.

A good example of this use case is [Example of open learning module]().

## Support Resource in Educational Activities

NDP Modules can play a crucial role in supporting activities like data challenges and hackathons by providing participants with resources and a starting point for the activity.

An agency might organize a data challenge on the NDP aimed at developing a model to address a complex problem using their datasets. To support this challenge, an NDP module can be included, offering a replicable base solution. This module helps participants gain a clear understanding of the challenge's objectives, the structure of the required workflow, and provides a solid foundation upon which they can build more advanced solutions.

A good example of this case is the [Base Solution]() of the [NDP Data Challenge]().

## Community Training

Research groups and agencies that contribute resources to NDP—such as datasets and services—have the opportunity to develop NDP modules designed as demos or tutorials. These modules serve as valuable tools to train the broader community on how to effectively utilize their resources. Some examples are the following:

Example 1: Data Utilization and Visualization

Modules can be used to demonstrate how to utilize a sample dataset provided by the research group or agency and teach users how to process, analyze, and visualize the data, potentially incorporating live streaming or real-time data visualization techniques.

Example 2: AI Model Training

Modules can be created that guide learners through the process of using an AI model or service. For example, a Jupyter notebook within the module could demonstrate how to apply a specific AI model to a real-world dataset, guiding users through the practical application of the model, demonstrating how to effectively leverage its capabilities for meaningful analysis and decision-making.

A good sample module of this use case is the [NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Foundational Model Demo]().
