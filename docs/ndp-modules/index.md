# Modules

To enhance the learning experience and facilitate knowledge sharing, the National Data Platform provides the opportunity to create Modules.

Modules are versatile learning objects deployable in Wildfire Commons's JupyterHub service. A module is a combination of data, AI/ML models and executable code-primarily in the form of Jupyter Notebooks-to achieve a specific educational or training objective.  

## Why Modules?

The following features highlight some of the advantages of using Modules.

#### Effortless Access and Deployment

Modules can be accessed and deployed by anyone with an account.There's no need for local setup or installation as everything runs in the JupyterHub service. 

#### Leverage Catalog

The catalog is rich with datasets covering a wide range of wildfire areas of practice. The data is not only large, but also complex, offering deep insights and challenges. 

#### Utilize High-Performance Resources

Modules provide educators with the computational resources needed for advanced learning. The JupyterHub service integrates GPUs and other high-performance resources to explore AI, machine learning, and other computationally intensive topics, providing access to cutting-edge education and knowledge.

#### Enhance Research Exposure

Modules increase the visibility of researchers. Researchers can use modules to share their expertise and resources, reaching a broad audience of students, educators, and fellow researchers. This increased exposure can lead to new collaborations, citations, and recognition in their respective academic fields.
