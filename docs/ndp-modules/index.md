# NDP Modules

To democratize the learning experience and facilitate knowledge sharing, the National Data Platform provides the opportunity to create NDP Modules.

NDP Modules are versatile learning objects deployable in NDP's JupyterHub service. A module is a combination of data, AI/ML models and executable code-primarily in the form of Jupyter Notebooks-to achieve a specific educational or training objective.  

## Why NDP Modules?

The following features highlight some of the advantages of using NDP Modules.

#### Effortless Access and Deployment

NDP modules can be accessed and deployed by anyone with an NDP account.There's no need for local setup or installation as everything runs in the NDP JupyterHub service. 

#### Leverage NDP Data Catalog

The NDP catalog is rich with datasets covering a wide range of scientific research areas. The data is not only large, but also complex, offering deep insights and challenges. 

#### Utilize High-Performance Resources

NDP modules provide educators with the computational resources needed for advanced learning. The JupyterHub service integrates GPUs and other high-performance resources to explore AI, machine learning, and other computationally intensive topics that would otherwise be inaccessible, democratizing access to cutting-edge education and knowledge.

#### Enhance Research Exposure

NDP modules increase the visibility of researchers. Researchers can use NDP modules to share their expertise and resources, reaching a broad audience of students, educators, and fellow researchers. This increased exposure can lead to new collaborations, citations, and recognition in their respective academic fields.
