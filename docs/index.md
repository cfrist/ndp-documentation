# Wildfire Commons Documentation

This is the official documentation site for the [Wildfire Commons](https://www.wildfirecommons.org/).

We believe that avoiding devastating wildfires requires urgent, innovative, and collaborative solutions. The Wildfire Science & Technology Commons is a bold new initiative designed to accelerate technological innovations for wildfire management and mitigation. We are building a community platform around open data, cutting-edge science, AI, and shared knowledge.

Our Mission and Vision
Our mission is to bring people together to break down the barriers that currently exist between wildfire-related data, models, and tools. Today these resources are siloed, which slows down innovation. We have the opportunity to create a seamless, smart platform to enable solutions that revolutionize how we understand, respond to, and prevent wildfires. Together, we can protect lives, property, and ecosystems from the ever-growing threat of wildfires.

The Wildfire Science & Technology Commons is a UC San Diego initiative funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Special thanks to Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) and Representatives Juan Vargas (CA-52) and Sara Jacobs (CA-51) for their support of this project through the Congressional appropriations process.
