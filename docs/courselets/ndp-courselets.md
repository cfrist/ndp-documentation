# NDP Courselets

"Courselets" are open Jupyter Notebooks designed for easy launching and seamless integration within our platform. These courselets provide a structured yet flexible framework for educators to deliver interactive and engaging course materials, facilitating a hands-on learning experience for students.

Educators are encouraged to contribute to an open collection of courselets. By participating in this open collection, educators can showcase their expertise, share best practices, and contribute to the advancement of education in the field of AI and beyond
