# Wildfire Commons Documentation

Avoiding devastating wildfires requires urgent, innovative, and collaborative solutions. The Wildfire Science & Technology Commons is a bold new initiative designed to accelerate technological innovations for wildfire management and mitigation. We are building a community platform around open data, cutting-edge science, AI, and shared knowledge. 

The [Wildfire Science & Technology Commons (Wildfire Commons)](https://www.wildfirecommons.org/) is a community platform for wildfire-related data, models, tools, and services. Community members can join the Expert Network and list their wildfire research projects, organizations, or initiatives as Pathfinders. Once you have joined the Expert Network and listed your initiative as a Pathfinder, you can begin using the FireForge Platform, an extension of the National Data Platform for the wildfire community.
