# Education Hub

The National Data Platform's Education Hub aims to democratize access to advanced computational tools, resources, and AI-ready data, empowering the development of an AI-ready workforce. It enables instructors to deliver resource-intensive courses, facilitate data challenges, and share their expertise through hands-on, open learning resources. This hub is designed to support the growth of practical, skill-based education in AI and computational fields.

## Features


- [NDP Modules](../ndp-modules/index.md): Modules are versatile learning objects that contain data, code, and additional resources that can be deployed and executed in JupyterHub. Modules are intended to provide a hands-on learning experience.

- [NDP Classroom](../ndp-classroom/index.md): Classroom allows instructors to conduct their courses within NDP. Classrooms incorporate multiple modules and allow students to be assigned to groups for collaborative work.
