# Registering Data, Models, and Services in the catalog

The Community Catalog is a metadata registry that enables Wildfire Commons contributors to expose their datasets, models and services to the WSTC community.

By registering their resources in the Community Catalog, organizations can increase the visibility and reach of their data, facilitating collaboration, innovation, and the advancement of wildfire research.

**Please note that the catalog does not store or host the any data**. Instead, contributors provide access information to their datasets, models, and services which are hosted externally.

For the registration of a dataset, models, or services, providers must fill the following information in the data registration form:

- **Title:** A concise and descriptive title that accurately represents the product. 
- **Description:** A detailed and informative description of the product, including its purpose, scope, and content. This should provide enough context for potential users to understand the dataset's value and relevance.
- **Tags:** Relevant keywords or phrases that help categorize and make the product discoverable. Choose a mix of specific terms related to the product's content and broader, high-level terms that reflect its themes or applications. 
- **Organization:** A detailed and informative description of the product, including its purpose, scope, and content. This should provide enough context for potential users to understand the product's value and relevance. The Catalog provides a list of organizations, but data providers can also add their organization through the form.
- **Visibility:** Public or private.

!!! info "Public visibility"
    In the current version of the Wildfire Commons, all metadata is registered with public visibility.

- **Point of contact information:** The name, email address and phone number of the author or maintainer of the product.
- **Public Key:** A unique identifier or API key required for accessing the product, if applicable. Provide this key if your product is hosted behind a restricted access point or requires authentication.
- **Version:** The current version number or release date of the product.
- **License:** The terms and conditions under which the product can be used, shared, or adapted. 
- **Resources:** Additional URLs, documentation, or materials that provide context or support for the dataset. This may include data dictionaries, user guides, or other supplementary resources that help users understand and work with the product.
- **Optional Custom Fields:** The CKAN ID or URL where the data is derived from (optional) and the size of the whole packaged product.
- **Additional Information:** Any other relevant details or comments about the product that are not captured by the other fields.

The process to register your data is the following:

1. After login in, go to *My Uploads* on the left side of your dashboard.



2. On the top, click on *Register*.
3. Fill the data registration form with the information we described previously and submit your request. 

After submitting your data registration form, you will receive a confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your submission. This email confirms that we have received your request and will begin the review process.

Our team will carefully review your submission to ensure it meets the standards and requirements of the catalog. Please be patient as we complete this review process, as it may take some time.

Once the review is complete, you will receive a second email informing you of the outcome, either accepting or rejecting your product for inclusion in the catalog. If your product is rejected, it is because it did not meet the necessary standards.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the review process or would like clarification on the status of your submission, please don't hesitate to contact our team for assistance. We're here to help and look forward to working with you to make your product available to the scientific community.
