# Key Features

Some of the key features of NDP are:

#### AI-Ready Data 

NDP provides structured, curated datasets that are optimized for AI projects, allowing users to focus on insights and analysis rather than data preparation.

#### Computational Resources

Integrated high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud resources are available for data processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) applications.

#### Collaborative Workspace 

A centralized, web-based interface enables multiple users to work together, sharing resources, tools, and data in real-time.

#### Reference Architecture 

The platform is built on a robust architecture that includes a Centralized Hub for data and computing access, a PoP Factory for federated points of presence, and a suite of Standard Services such as authentication, authorization, and orchestration.

#### Education Hub

Hands-on NDP modules and NDP classrooms support open learning and courses that require advanced computational tools, resources, and AI-ready data, enabling students to engage with cyberinfrastructure.

#### Equitable Access 

One of the platform’s core principles is promoting equity by ensuring all users, regardless of background or institution, have access to high-quality data and computational tools.
