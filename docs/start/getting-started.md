NDP is aimed to:

- Facilitate [data registration](../catalog/register-data.md), [discovery](../catalog/catalog.md) and usage through a centralized hub
- Enhance distributed CI capabilities through distributed [points of presence](../pop/index.md)   
- Cultivate resources for [classroom education](../ndp-classroom/index.md) and [data challenges](../)
- Assist research and learning through personalized [workspaces](../workspace/index.md)
