# Understanding the Wildfire Commons

Our mission is to bring people together to break down the barriers that currently exist between wildfire-related data, models, and tools. Today these resources are siloed, which slows down innovation. We have the opportunity to create a seamless, smart platform to enable solutions that revolutionize how we understand, respond to, and prevent wildfires.

The Wildfire Commons' aim is to:
- accelerate innovation
- foster open science
- promote transparency
- enable collaboration
- prepare for scale
- forge coalitions

Driving tasks for the Wildfire Commons to achieve these goals include:
- Building an Expert Network: Engage the wildfire science and technology community, as well as the community of application, to support thought leadership of the Wildfire Commons.
- Wildfire Commons Framework: Develop a functional framework for the integration and sharing of data, models, and tools to drive next-generation fire science and operational practice.
- Case Studies for Vegetation & Fuel: Demonstrate impact through interconnected case studies related to landscape and wildland fire fuels management technologies.
- Pathfinder Projects for Future Directions: Work with the community of practice to select pathfinder projects to scale data and models for future application.
- Creation of Blueprint for Future Phases: Planning achievable, scalable, and sustained use of the Wildfire Commons for collective impact.
