# Registering Data in NDP catalog

The NDP catalog is a metadata registry that enables organizations to expose their datasets to the scientific community, making them available for incorporation into AI-driven workflows and advancing research in various fields.

By registering their datasets in the NDP catalog, organizations can increase the visibility and reach of their data, facilitating collaboration, innovation, and the advancement of research.

**Please note that the NDP catalog does not store or host the actual data**. Instead, users provide a URL for direct download or an API key to facilitate access to their datasets, which are hosted externally.

For the registration of a dataset, data providers must fill the following information in the data registration form:

- **Title**
- **Description**
- **Tags** 
- **Organization**
- **Visibility**
- **Point of contact information**
- **Public Key**
- **Version**
- **License**
- **Resources**
- **Optional Custom Fields**
- **Aditional Information**

The process to register your data is the following:

1. After login in, go to *My Uploads* on the left side of your dashboard.
2. On the top, click on *Register dataset*.
3. Fill the data registration form with the information we described previously and submit your request. 

After submitting your data registration form, you will receive a confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your submission. This email confirms that we have received your request and will begin the review process.

Our team will carefully review your dataset to ensure it meets the standards and requirements of the National Data Platform catalog. Please be patient as we complete this review process, as it may take some time.

Once the review is complete, you will receive a second email informing you of the outcome, either accepting or rejecting your dataset for inclusion in the catalog. If your dataset is rejected, it is because it did not meet the necessary standards.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the review process or would like clarification on the status of your submission, please don't hesitate to contact our team for assistance. We're here to help and look forward to working with you to make your dataset available to the scientific community.
