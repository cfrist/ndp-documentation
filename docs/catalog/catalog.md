# Data Catalog 

One of the key features of NDP is its extensive and diverse data catalog, which offers a broad selection of datasets and data streams covering various scientific domains. This catalog is enriched through collaboration with numerous organizations and researchers, who contribute datasets which are accessible via the platformâ€™s registration service. 

To streamline data discovery, NDP integrates a search engine that enables users to locate datasets quickly and efficiently. 

#### Substring Search 

Users can perform a simple substring search, which returns a list of datasets containing the specified substring in either the file name or metadata. This allows for broad searches across the dataset collection, making it easy to locate relevant data with basic keywords.

#### Annotated Search

For more refined searches, users can utilize the annotated search option. This search method returns datasets that match specific annotations, along with detailed statistics related to the occurrences of the search term within the available Open Knowledge Networks (OKNs). OKNs provide semantic linkages between datasets and facilitate more context-aware data exploration, allowing users to retrieve highly relevant and well-structured data.

#### Filtered Search

To further aid in data discovery, users have the option to filter their search results by the contributing organization. This feature is particularly useful for those looking to access datasets from specific institutions, research groups, or initiatives. Filtering helps narrow down search results and ensures that users find data that aligns with their project needs or institutional collaborations.
