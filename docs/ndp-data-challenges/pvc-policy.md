# PVC Policy

This page outlines the policies governing the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) associated with data challenges. Please review these guidelines to ensure that you manage your stored work effectively.

**⚠ Note:** This policy applies only to PVCs associated with data challenges. User storage (such as personal directories or long-term storage) is not affected by these retention rules.

## 1. PVC Retention After a Data Challenge Ends

- When a data challenge officially concludes, you will receive an email notification informing you that your PVC will be retained for 7 days.
- You have one week to retrieve your work before the PVC is permanently deleted.
- After this period, all associated storage will be automatically removed, and recovery will not be possible.

## 2. PVC Access in Case of an Unexpected Data Challenge Deletion

- If a data challenge is abruptly deleted by the challenge host, an email notification will be sent to you.
- You will have a 24-hour window to retrieve your data before the PVC is permanently deleted.
- It is recommended that you back up important work regularly to avoid data loss in such scenarios.

## 3. PVC Access Upon Leaving a Data Challenge
- If you voluntarily leave a data challenge or are removed from it, you will immediately lose access to your PVC.
- The PVC will remain accessible only to active participants of the challenge.
- If you need to retain your data, ensure you download or back up your work before leaving the challenge.

Best Practices for Managing Your PVC
- Check Email Notifications – Pay attention to emails regarding data retention timelines.
- Retrieve Work Promptly – Make sure to download important files before the retention period expires.

## Important Reminder
- Once a PVC is deleted, recovery is not possible. Please ensure you take appropriate steps to safeguard your data.
- User storage (e.g., personal home directories or other long-term storage) is not affected by this policy and will remain accessible.
