# Hosting a Data Challenge on NDP

This page provides guidelines for scientists, educators, and policymakers to host data challenges in the NDP Education Hub.

## Preparing Your Challenge

Before creating your challenge on NDP, ensure you have the following information and steps completed:

### Obtain Educator Credentials

Hosting data challenges is restricted to collaborators with educator credentials. To obtain these credentials, [contact us](../general/contact.md) to make your request.

### Explore Data Catalog / Register Your Data

The data for your challenge must be available through the NDP catalog. You can either use data accessible via the [Data Catalog](../catalog/catalog.md) or [register your data](../catalog/register-data.md).

### Prepare Your Modules

Modules are hands-on resources for participants working on NDP. Before publishing your challenge, ensure all relevant modules are included. These modules can include:
    - A supporting module to train participants on interacting with datasets or models.
    - A base solution for the challenge.
    - A base module to facilitate team workflow development.

It is essential to test modules before publication to ensure they function correctly and specify the resources participants need to reserve when working on JupyterHub.

Learn more about modules in [this section](../ndp-modules/index.md).

## Setting Up Your Challenge

1. Navigate to the Educator Portal within the NDP Education Hub. If you do not see the Educator Portal, you may not have **educator credentials** (refer to the previous section).
2. Click on *New Data Challenge*.
3. Provide the initial data challenge information:
    - **Title of the Data Challenge**
    - **Hosting Institution**
    - **Contact Information**: For participant questions or concerns.
    - **Start and End Dates**
4. Ensure all required fields are completed before clicking on *Set Up Data Challenge*.
5. Complete the main data challenge information:
    - **Goal**: A concise statement describing the main objective of the challenge (e.g., *Develop a new segmentation model for burn scar detection*). This goal should captivate interest and succinctly present the problem to be addressed.
    - **Background**: Provide context and information that led to the creation of the challenge.
    - **Challenge Description**: Offer a detailed description of the challenge, including stages, module usage, and expected outputs.
    - **Rules**: Specify all rules, such as eligibility, platform usage guidelines, and disqualifying actions.
    - **Prize**: If applicable, include prize details for display on the *Explore* page.
    - **FAQ**: Add potential Frequently Asked Questions.
    - **Dataset Details**: Include metadata, supporting resources, and data distribution for training, validation, and testing. Ensure the data is [registered in the data catalog](../catalog/register-data.md) and accessible through a module.
6. **Add Modules**:
    - Click on *Add a module* to include modules in your Data Challenge. Only published modules will be available in the dropdown menu.
    - Ensure the challenge description clearly outlines the module workflow.
7. **Publish Your Data Challenge**:
    - Before publishing, you can make changes to your text and modules.
    - Once published, no further modifications can be made.
